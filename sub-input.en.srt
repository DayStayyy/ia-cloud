00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:3,680 
 Mr. President, we asked our viewers if they had questions. Here are a couple. 

2 
00:00:3,680 --> 00:00:7,600 
 Jamie T. from Virginia said one of your biggest messages in campaign slogans was 

3 
00:00:7,600 --> 00:00:10,800 
 drain the swamp. With the idea that serving the American people is a 

4 
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,240 
 privilege and not a career and the politicians are supposed to answer to 

5 
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,200 
 the American people and not the opposite, when will your administration be putting 

6 
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,720 
 together a proposal for term limits for Congress? Well we're looking into that 

7 
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,550 
 right now. Right now I want to get those congressmen to go and approve it about Obamacare and all the. Well, we're looking into that right now. 

8 
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,750 
 Right now, I want to get those congressmen to go and approve Obamacare and all the different 

9 
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,750 
 things that we're working on. 

10 
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,750 
 One step at a time. 

11 
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,750 
 We'll be doing it, really. 

12 
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,390 
 I mean, that's something down the road a little bit. 

13 
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,190 
 A lot of people don't like that. 

14 
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,790 
 Frankly, you know, they consider term limits to be an election, but I think it would be 

15 
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,790 
 a good thing. 

16 
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,930 
 But right now, what I want to do is get Obamacare approved and I want people to love us. 

17 
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,930 
 Approved or changed? 

18 
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,330 
 Well, really, well, changed when I say Obamacare. 

19 
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,630 
 I mean, I'm talking about real change. 

20 
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,550 
 And I suspect the first thing that's going to change will be the name. 

21 
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,790 
 But we're talking about repealing and replacing. 

22 
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,930 
 And if we don't do that, I would be very upset. 

23 
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:1,240 
 Nobody's going to get thrown out of their insurance, are they? 

24 
00:01:1,240 --> 00:01:3,320 
 Because that's what a lot of people are saying on the left. 

25 
00:01:3,320 --> 00:01:5,080 
 They're saying millions of people are gonna lose the insurance. 

26 
00:01:5,080 --> 00:01:6,080 
 No, they have it all wrong. 

27 
00:01:6,080 --> 00:01:8,840 
 And you're gonna hear about it during the speech, but they have it all wrong. 

28 
00:01:8,840 --> 00:01:12,760 
 We're gonna have a really great healthcare plan, and 

29 
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,200 
 it's gonna be much more affordable, including for the country. 

30 
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,280 
 Go ahead. 

31 
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,050 
 I know when you were inaugurated, you put your hand on your Bible that your mother 

32 
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,210 
 had given you as a child. 

33 
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,310 
 I know as a mother, as parents, we pray for our children. 

34 
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,310 
 We want the best for them. 

35 
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,190 
 And your parents, they probably prayed for you so much, but maybe not, they might not 

36 
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,690 
 have realized that you were going to get this far. 

37 
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,810 
 And I know they would be very proud of you. 

38 
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,010 
 That leads me to this question. 

39 
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,130 
 Ronald wrote us and said, 

40 
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,810 
 I pray for you daily. 

41 
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,850 
 Do you take time to pray? 

42 
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,110 
 I do actually. 

43 
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,270 
 And to me it's very important, but that's so nice. 

44 
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,110 
 Who is that? 

45 
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,930 
 That's Ronald. 

46 
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,770 
 Well, hello Ronald. 

47 
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,490 
 We ought to bring Ronald to the White House. 

48 
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,610 
 He'd be happy to come. 

49 
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,530 
 I like Ronald. 

50 
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,970 
 And this is the last one. 

51 
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,370 
 Alan Sherman from Queen says, 

52 
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,000 
 I'm a diehard New York Mets fan since you're a native of the Great Borrower Queens, but moved to Manhattan. 

53 
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:3,000 
 Are you a Mets fan or a Yankees fan? The fate of the world relies on this answer. 

54 
00:02:3,000 --> 00:02:7,000 
 Well, I don't think it does, but actually, I do like both teams. 

55 
00:02:7,000 --> 00:02:12,000 
 And I love the Steinbrenner family and the Wilpont family and Randy Levine and the whole group. 

56 
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,030 
 Randy has done a terrific job. He's involved with the Yankees. 

57 
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,550 
 Now you're probably going to win New York. 

58 
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,710 
 Well, I don't know, but I do like both teams. 

59 
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,710 
 I really do. 

60 
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,710 
 What about Social Security? 

61 
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,110 
 People my age are worried that it might run out by the time we need it. 

62 
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,110 
 You're going to be okay. 

63 
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,190 
 That was Angelie from Manhattan.
